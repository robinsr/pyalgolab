# Practice Roadmap

Progressively ordered algorithm questions for `pyalgolab`.

Marked off as they are completed.

## Completed
- [x] Basic binary search
- [x] Search insert position
- [x] Search range (first/last occurrence)
- [x] Two sum
- [x] Merge two sorted lists
- [x] Valid parenthesis

## Search Extensions
- [ ] Search in rotated sorted array
- [ ] Find minimum in rotated sorted array

## Two-Pointer Patterns
- [ ] Remove duplicates from sorted array
- [ ] Move zeros / partition array
- [ ] Container with most water
- [ ] 3-sum
- [ ] 3-sum closest
- [ ] 3-sum count (variations)

## Linked List Progression
- [ ] Reverse linked list
- [ ] Detect cycle in linked list (Floyd’s Tortoise & Hare)
- [ ] Intersection of two linked lists
- [ ] Add two numbers (LL as number representation)

## Stack / Parentheses Extensions
- [ ] Min stack
- [ ] Daily temperatures (monotonic stack)
- [ ] Largest rectangle in histogram

## Intervals / Greedy
- [ ] Merge intervals
- [ ] Insert interval
- [ ] Meeting rooms I
- [ ] Meeting rooms II

## Binary Search on Answer
- [ ] Koko eating bananas (min speed)
- [ ] Split array largest sum
- [ ] Median of two sorted arrays

## Heap / Priority Queue
- [ ] Kth largest element in array
- [ ] Merge k sorted lists
- [ ] Top k frequent elements

## Dynamic Programming (Basics)
- [ ] Climbing stairs
- [ ] Coin change (min coins)
- [ ] Longest increasing subsequence
- [ ] Maximum subarray (Kadane’s algorithm)

## Graph Foundations
- [ ] Number of islands (DFS/BFS)
- [ ] Max area of island
- [ ] Course schedule (topological sort)
